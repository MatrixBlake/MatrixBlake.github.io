This is Kunze Wang, and I am currently a machine learning engineer and applied scientist at [Rokt](https://www.rokt.com/), where I work on computational advertising and recommendation systems.

Before joining Rokt, I completed my PhD at The University of Sydney, supervised by [Dr.Caren Han](https://drcarenhan.github.io/) and Dr. Josiah Poon. During my time at USYD, I visited The University of Hong Kong and The University of Western Australia, and interned at Meituan Company.

Prior to that, I earned my Master of Information Technology and Information Technology Management at USYD. I completed my bachelor's degree at Nanjing University and graduated with honors.

My research interests include graph neural networks for text classification, knowledge graphs, abusive language detection, and, like everyone else recently, large language models :)
